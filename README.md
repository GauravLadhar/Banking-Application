# Banking Application Information

Developed a Java-based, multi-page banking application that enables secure and seamless account management for both customers and employees. This dynamic interface allows users to perform essential banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. I designed advanced graphical elements to create a visually appealing, responsive user experience across multiple pages.

To start, a customer would first create an account using a secure creation page. The customer would then have the ability to bank using the application.

An employee has access to customer details and management tools using a secure login.
